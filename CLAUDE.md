# Habitat Skills

This is a collection of AI agent skills for founders. Skills are markdown files in `skills/` that provide structured frameworks for building startups.

## Key conventions

- Every skill has a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (name, description)
- Skills should check for `.claude/founder-context.md` before gathering context
- Keep skill files under 500 lines
- Reference related skills to help with routing
- All skills follow the same pattern: gather context → apply framework → deliver actionable output
