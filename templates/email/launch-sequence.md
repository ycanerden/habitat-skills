Hi [Name],

I haven't heard from you since [Product Name] launched, so I wanted to check in.

Is [Product Name] not the right fit? Or did you just get busy?

If it's not a fit, no worries—I'd love to know why so I can improve.

If you're still interested but have questions, let me know. I'm happy to:
- Walk you through a demo
- Answer any questions
- Set up a custom trial

Just reply "interested" and I'll take care of the rest.

[Your Name]

P.S. If you'd prefer I don't email you about this, just reply "unsubscribe" and I'll remove you from this list. No hard feelings!

## Tips for Better Results

**Subject lines:**
- Keep under 50 characters
- Use numbers when possible ("Save 5 hours/week")
- Create curiosity ("You're missing out on this...")

**Email body:**
- Get to the point in the first sentence
- Use bullets for scannability
- One clear call-to-action
- Make it personal (use "I" not "we")

**Timing:**
- Send during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM recipient's timezone)
- Tuesday-Thursday get highest open rates
- Avoid Mondays (inbox overload) and Fridays (people check out)

**A/B test:**
- Test subject lines (send half with one subject, half with another)
- See which gets higher open rates
- Use the winner for future emails
