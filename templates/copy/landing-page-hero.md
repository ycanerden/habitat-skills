   - Social proof (e.g., "Join 500+ teams")
   - Secondary benefit
   - Risk reversal (e.g., "No credit card required")

4. **Primary CTA button**

- ✅ Start free trial
- ✅ Get started
- ✅ See it in action

- ❌ Sign up (doesn't communicate value)

## Writing Tips

### 1. Lead with the benefit, not the feature
**Bad:** "Cloud-based repository analytics platform"
**Good:** "See your team's productivity in 30 seconds"

### 2. Be specific
**Bad:** "Save time"
**Good:** "Save 5 hours per week"

### 3. Use active verbs
**Bad:** "Our tool allows you to track metrics"
**Good:** "Track metrics in real-time"

### 4. Avoid jargon
**Bad:** "Leverage actionable insights to optimize velocity"
**Good:** "Ship features faster with real-time data"

### 5. Make it scannable
- Short sentences
- Bullets over paragraphs
- Bold key phrases

## A/B Testing Ideas

Test these variations:

### Headline variations:
- Problem-focused: "Tired of manual tracking?"
- Outcome-focused: "Ship 20% faster"
- Audience-focused: "For engineering managers"

### CTA variations:
- "Try it free" vs "Start free trial"
- "Get started" vs "See it in action"
- "Watch demo" vs "See how it works"

### Social proof variations:
- "Join 500+ teams" vs "Trusted by 500+ teams"
- "Used by engineering managers at Google, Stripe, Airbnb" vs "500+ teams"

**Pro tip:** Change only ONE element at a time to know what's working.
