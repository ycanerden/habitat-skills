# First Users

You are helping a founder find their first users. Not thousands — the first 10, then 100. This is manual, unscalable, high-touch work. That's the point.

## Before Starting

**Check for context first:**
If `.claude/founder-context.md` exists, read it. Pay attention to target audience, where they hang out, and validation status.

If no context exists, gather:
- What's the product? (one sentence)
- Who is the ideal first user? (be specific)
- What do you have live? (landing page, prototype, full product)
- What's your goal? (email signups, beta testers, paying customers)

## The First Users Framework

### Stage 1: First 10 Users (Manual, 1-on-1)

**Goal:** Get 10 real people using your product and giving feedback.

**Rule:** Do things that don't scale. Personally recruit every one of these 10.

#### Where to Find Them

Based on the founder's audience, recommend specific channels:

| Audience Type | Where to Find Them | Approach |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Developers** | GitHub, Hacker News, Dev.to, Discord servers, Twitter/X | Share what you built, ask for feedback |
| **Founders/builders** | Indie Hackers, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Habitat community | DM directly, offer early access |
| **Designers** | Dribbble, Behance, Twitter/X, Slack communities | Show the product, ask for their perspective |
| **Marketers** | LinkedIn, Marketing Twitter, GrowthHackers, Slack groups | Share results/data, offer free access |
| **Small businesses** | Local Facebook groups, Google Maps, industry forums | Cold email, show up in person |
| **Consumers** | Reddit, Facebook groups, TikTok, Instagram | Post in relevant communities, engage genuinely |
| **Enterprise** | LinkedIn, industry events, warm intros | Outbound + warm referrals only |

#### Outreach Templates

**DM / Cold Email (keep it short):**
```
Subject: Quick question about [their problem]

Hi [name],

I noticed you [something specific — posted about X, work on Y, mentioned Z].

I'm building [product] — [one sentence what it does]. We're looking for 10 early users to shape the product.

Would you be up for trying it out? I'd love your honest feedback.

[link]

[your name]
```

**Key rules:**
- Personalize the first line (reference something specific about THEM)
- Keep it under 5 sentences
- Ask for feedback, not a sale
- Include a direct link
- No follow-up spam — one follow-up max, 3-5 days later

**Community Post (Reddit, forums, etc.):**
```
[Title: specific to the community's interest]

Hey [community name],

I've been [personal context — why you care about this problem].

I built [product] to [solve X]. It's early, and I'd love feedback from people who [experience the problem].

Here's what it does: [2-3 bullets]

If you want to try it: [link]

Happy to answer any questions. And if this isn't useful — tell me that too. Honest feedback > polite silence.
```

**Key rules:**
- Be a community member first, promoter second
- Lead with your story, not your product
- Explicitly invite criticism
- Don't spam multiple subreddits with the same post

### Stage 2: First 100 Users (Semi-Manual, 1-to-Many)

**Goal:** Grow from 10 to 100 through word-of-mouth, content, and community.

#### Tactic Menu

Help the founder pick 2-3 tactics based on their strengths:

| Tactic | Effort | Time to Results | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Build in public** (Twitter/X, LinkedIn) | Medium | 2-4 weeks | Founders with an audience or willingness to post |
| **Community participation** | Medium | 2-4 weeks | Anyone willing to be helpful in communities |
| **Cold outreach at scale** | High | 1-2 weeks | B2B products with clear buyer persona |
| **Product Hunt launch** | High (one-time) | 1 day | Products with visual appeal or clear category |
| **Content/SEO** | High | 2-6 months | Long-term play, not for immediate traction |
| **Referral loop** | Low-Medium | 2-4 weeks | Products with natural sharing (collab tools, social) |
| **Partner with communities** | Medium | 1-2 weeks | Products built for a specific community |
| **Free tool / lead magnet** | High | 2-4 weeks | Products where a free tool naturally leads to the paid product |

#### Build in Public Playbook

If the founder chooses this:

**What to post:**
- Day 1: "I'm building X because [personal story]"
- Progress updates: "Shipped [feature] today. Here's why."
- Metrics (honest): "Day 7: 12 signups, 3 active users. Here's what I'm learning."
- User feedback: "A user told me [insight]. Changing [thing] based on this."
- Behind-the-scenes: Photos, screenshots, code snippets, failed experiments

**Where to post:**
- LinkedIn (if audience is professional/B2B)
- Twitter/X (if audience is tech/startup)
- Both (cross-post with platform-native formatting)

**Cadence:** 3-5x per week minimum. Consistency > quality at this stage.

#### The Feedback Loop

For the first 100 users, every user interaction should feed back into the product:

```
Get a user → Watch them use it → Ask what's broken → Fix it → Ask for a referral → Repeat
```

**After every user interaction, ask:**
1. "What did you expect to happen that didn't?"
2. "Would you recommend this to someone? Who?"
3. "What would make you use this every day/week?"

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | What to Do Instead |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| "I'll launch and they'll come" | Nobody knows you exist | Manually tell 50 people |
| Posting once and giving up | You need 10+ touchpoints | Post consistently for 30 days |
| Targeting everyone | If it's for everyone, it's for no one | Pick your 1 ideal user and find 10 of them |
| Optimizing for scale at 10 users | You don't have a scale problem | Have 10 great conversations instead |
| Asking friends and family | They'll be polite, not honest | Find strangers who have the actual problem |
| Spending money on ads before PMF | You're paying to learn things you could learn for free | Do outreach and content first |

## Principles

- **Manual first.** Your first 10 users should all come from personal outreach. If you can't convince 10 people 1-on-1, ads won't fix it.
- **Talk to users, not about users.** Every "user" is a person. Have conversations. Learn their names.
- **Feedback is the product.** At this stage, user feedback is more valuable than user count. 10 users who talk to you > 100 silent signups.
- **Consistency over intensity.** 5 outreach messages per day for 30 days beats 100 messages in one afternoon.
- **Uncomfortable is good.** If outreach feels easy, you're probably not reaching enough strangers. The best early users are people you don't already know.
