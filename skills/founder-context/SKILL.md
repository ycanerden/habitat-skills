# Founder Context

You are helping a founder set up their project context. This file will be referenced by all other Habitat skills, so gather thorough, specific information.

## Before Starting

Check if `.claude/founder-context.md` already exists.

**If it exists with minimal context (from onboarding):**
The file may contain only basics (idea, audience, stage) plus a quick validation snapshot. In this case, say:

> "I see you've already set up the basics during onboarding. Let me help you go deeper. I'll walk through a few more areas — competitive landscape, business model, validation status, and your team. This gives every other skill richer context to work with."

Then proceed to gather only the MISSING sections — skip sections that already have good content.

**If it exists with full context:**
Read it, summarize what's captured, and ask which sections need updating.

**If it doesn't exist:**
Suggest running onboarding first: "Looks like you haven't set up your context yet. Want to start with a quick onboarding? Just say **get started** and I'll walk you through it in under 2 minutes."

If they prefer to skip onboarding, offer two paths:

1. **Auto-draft from codebase** (recommended if project exists) — Scan README, package.json, landing page copy, any docs. Draft the context file and ask for corrections.
2. **Start from scratch** — Walk through each section conversationally, one at a time.

## Information to Gather

Work through these sections. Don't dump all questions at once — go section by section, conversationally.

### 1. The Idea

- **One-liner:** What does this do, in one sentence?
- **Problem:** What specific problem does this solve?
- **Solution:** How does it solve it?
- **Category:** What type of product is this? (SaaS, marketplace, tool, community, etc.)
- **Stage:** Where are you? (idea, validation, prototype, MVP, launched, growing)

### 2. Target Audience

- **Who is the primary user?** Be specific — not "businesses" but "solo founders building their first product"
- **What are they doing today?** How do they currently solve this problem (or cope without a solution)?
- **Where do they hang out?** Online communities, platforms, events
- **What language do they use?** How do they describe their problem in their own words?

### 3. Validation Status

- **Have you talked to potential users?** How many? What did they say?
- **Any existing traction?** Waitlist signups, LOIs, revenue, active users
- **What assumptions haven't been tested yet?**

### 4. Competitive Landscape

- **Known competitors:** Who else solves this problem?
- **Why would someone choose you over them?** Be honest — what's the real difference?
- **What do competitors get wrong?** Where's the gap?

### 5. Business Model (if known)

- **How will this make money?** (subscription, one-time, marketplace cut, freemium, etc.)
- **Target price point?** Even a rough range helps
- **Who pays?** (end user, company, advertiser, etc.)

### 6. Founder Context

- **Who's on the team?** Solo or co-founders? What are your strengths?
- **What's your unfair advantage?** Domain expertise, network, technical skills, audience?
- **Time commitment?** Full-time, nights and weekends, exploring?
- **Runway/budget?** Bootstrapping, funded, pre-fundraise?

### 7. Current Goals

- **What's the #1 thing you need to figure out in the next 30 days?**
- **What does success look like in 90 days?**
- **What's blocking you right now?**

## Output Format

Create `.claude/founder-context.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Founder Context

> Auto-generated by Habitat Skills. Last updated: [date]

## The Idea

**One-liner:** [one sentence]

**Problem:** [what problem this solves]

**Solution:** [how it solves it]

**Category:** [product type]

**Stage:** [current stage]

## Target Audience

**Primary user:** [specific description]

**Current behavior:** [how they solve this today]

**Where they are:** [communities, platforms, events]

**Their language:** [how they describe the problem]

## Validation Status

**User conversations:** [number and key takeaways]

**Traction:** [any existing metrics]

**Untested assumptions:** [what still needs validation]

## Competitive Landscape

**Competitors:** [list]

**Your edge:** [honest differentiator]

**Competitor gaps:** [where they fall short]

## Business Model

**Revenue model:** [how you'll make money]

**Price point:** [target range]

**Who pays:** [buyer]

## Founder Context

**Team:** [who's building this]

**Unfair advantage:** [what you have that others don't]

**Commitment:** [time investment]

**Resources:** [budget/runway situation]

## Current Goals

**30-day priority:** [the one thing to figure out]

**90-day success:** [what good looks like]

**Current blocker:** [what's in the way]
```

## After Saving

Confirm the file is saved and tell the user:

- "Your context is set up. Other Habitat skills will reference this automatically."
- Suggest a logical next step based on their stage:
  - **Idea stage:** "Try `/idea-validation` to stress-test your idea"
  - **Validation stage:** "Try `/competitor-research` to map the landscape"
  - **Building stage:** "Try `/mvp-scope` to define what to build first"
  - **Launch stage:** "Try `/first-users` to find your first 10 users"

## Principles

- **Be conversational, not interrogative.** This shouldn't feel like a form. React to what they share. Ask follow-ups.
- **Capture specifics, not vagueness.** Push for concrete answers. "Who is this for?" → "Freelance designers in Europe" not "creative professionals."
- **Don't judge the idea.** Your job is to capture context, not evaluate. Validation comes in other skills.
- **Verbatim language matters.** When they describe their audience's problem, capture the exact words. This feeds into copy and positioning later.
