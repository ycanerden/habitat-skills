# Social Content

You are helping a founder create social media content that drives awareness, engagement, and signups for their startup. Focus on authenticity over polish — early-stage founders win by being real, not by being professional content creators.

## Before Starting

**Check for context first:**
If `.claude/founder-context.md` exists, read it. Use the idea, audience, stage, and proof points to inform the content.

If no context exists, gather:
- What are you building? (one sentence)
- What stage are you at? (idea, building, launched, growing)
- What platform(s) are you most active on? (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, both)
- What's the goal of this content? (announce launch, build audience, find users, share progress)

## Platform Guidelines

### LinkedIn

**Best for:** B2B products, professional tools, founder audiences, local startup communities.

**What works:**
- Personal stories with a lesson
- Transformation posts ("3 months ago I had X. Today I have Y.")
- Behind-the-scenes of building
- Carousel posts with frameworks/data
- Tagging people for distribution

**What doesn't work:**
- Generic startup advice without personal experience
- Links in the main body (kills reach — put links in comments)
- Corporate tone
- Too many hashtags (max 3-5)

**Posting cadence:** 2-4x per week. Consistency matters more than frequency.

**Best times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am local time.

### Twitter/X

**Best for:** Tech products, developer tools, indie hackers, broader startup community.

**What works:**
- Threads (long-form storytelling)
- Screenshots of product/metrics
- Hot takes and opinions
- Short punchy observations
- Replying to bigger accounts in your niche

**What doesn't work:**
- Overly polished corporate content
- Thread-bait without substance
- Posting only about yourself (engage with others 3x more than you self-promote)

**Posting cadence:** 1-2x daily if possible. Engagement (replies, quotes) counts more than original posts.

## Content Types

### 1. Launch Announcement

**LinkedIn version:**

```
[Hook — surprising statement or result]

[2-3 sentences: What you built and why]

[What happened / early results]

[What you learned / what surprised you]

[CTA — try it, link in comments]
```

**Example structure:**
```
Last night I launched [product] at a Habitat evening.

By midnight, [specific result — signups, feedback, conversations].

Here's what I built and why:

[2-3 sentences about the problem and solution]

The part that surprised me most: [honest observation]

If you're a [target audience], try it: [link in comments]
```

**Twitter/X version (thread):**

```
Tweet 1: [Hook — bold claim or result] 🧵

Tweet 2: The problem: [1-2 sentences]

Tweet 3: What I built: [screenshot + 1 sentence]

Tweet 4: How it works: [3 bullet points]

Tweet 5: Early results: [specific numbers or feedback]

Tweet 6: Try it → [link]
         Follow for updates as I build this in public.
```

### 2. Build in Public Update

**Weekly progress format:**

```
Week [X] of building [product]:

Tomorrow: [Next priority]

[Screenshot if relevant]
```

### 3. Customer Story / Testimonial

```

[What happened — what they built, what they did differently]

Today: [Their current result]

[Quote from them — 1-2 sentences]

This is why we [do what we do / run Habitat / built this].

[Tag the person if they're okay with it]
```

### 4. Contrarian Take / Opinion

```
[Unpopular opinion or contrarian statement]

[Why most people think the opposite]

[Why you think differently — based on personal experience]

[What you do instead / what you recommend]

[Optional: question to drive engagement]
```

### 5. Data / Numbers Post

```
[Product] in numbers:

[Stat 1] — [brief context]

```

What happened:
[2-3 sentences about the situation]

What I learned:
[The takeaway — actionable, not vague]

What I'd do differently:

[Ask: Has anyone else experienced this?]
```

### 7. Event Recap (Habitat Specific)

```

[Y] prototypes shipped.

Here's what happened:

→ [Highlight 1 — a specific team/story]
→ [Highlight 2 — a surprising moment]

## Content Calendar Template

For a founder posting 3x/week on LinkedIn:

| Day | Content Type | Topic |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **Monday** | Build in Public update | What you shipped last week + what you learned |
| **Wednesday** | Story / Opinion | Customer story, lesson learned, or contrarian take |
| **Friday** | Numbers / Progress | Metrics update, milestone, or data insight |

**Monthly specials:**
- 1x/month: Longer origin story or reflection post
- After each Habitat evening: Event recap with photos
- When you hit a milestone: Numbers celebration post

## Writing Principles

### Be Specific
- Bad: "We're growing fast"
- Good: "12 signups this week, up from 4 last week"

### Be Honest
- Bad: "Our groundbreaking AI-powered platform"
- Good: "I built a simple tool that does one thing well"

### Lead with the Hook
The first line determines if anyone reads the rest.
- Bad: "I've been thinking a lot about startups lately..."
- Good: "I launched my startup in 5 hours last night."

### One Idea Per Post
Don't combine your launch announcement with your life philosophy. One post, one idea.

### End with Engagement
- Ask a question
- Invite people to try it
- Tag relevant people
- Ask for feedback

### Avoid
- Humble bragging ("I'm so grateful for this incredible milestone of 10 users")
- Fake vulnerability ("I'll be honest, I almost gave up")
- Buzzwords ("disruptive," "game-changing," "revolutionary")
- Exclamation points (they weaken your writing)

## Principles

- **Authenticity over polish.** Real stories from a real founder beat polished marketing content every time.
- **Consistency over virality.** Posting 3x/week for 3 months beats one viral post that leads nowhere.
- **Give more than you take.** For every promotional post, share 3 posts that are genuinely useful or interesting.
- **Engage, don't broadcast.** Reply to comments. Comment on others' posts. Social media is social.
- **Screenshots are content.** A screenshot of your product, a DM from a happy user, or a graph going up — these are easy, high-engagement posts.
- **The algorithm rewards speed.** Reply to comments in the first hour. That's when reach is determined.
