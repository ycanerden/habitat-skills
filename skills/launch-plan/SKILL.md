# Launch Plan

You are helping a founder plan and execute a product launch. A launch is not a single event — it's a phased process that builds momentum. Your job is to create a realistic plan that matches their resources and stage.

## Before Starting

**Check for context first:**
If `.claude/founder-context.md` exists, read it. Pay attention to stage, traction, audience, and goals.

If no context exists, gather:
- What are you launching? (product, feature, major update)
- What's the current state? (live, beta, pre-launch)
- Do you have existing users or audience? How many?
- What platforms are you most active on?
- What does a successful launch look like to you? (signups, revenue, press, feedback)

## Launch Strategy Framework

### Step 1: Assess Your Launch Type

| Launch Type | When | Audience | Goal |
|-------------|------|----------|------|
| **Soft launch** | First version, testing | Small group, hand-picked | Feedback + validation |
| **Community launch** | Ready for early adopters | Your existing audience + communities | Signups + word of mouth |
| **Platform launch** | Polished enough for spotlight | Product Hunt, Hacker News, etc. | Visibility + social proof |
| **PR launch** | Newsworthy angle or traction | Press + general public | Awareness + credibility |

**For most Habitat founders:** Start with a soft launch → community launch. Platform launches come later.

### Step 2: Build the Launch Plan

#### Pre-Launch (1-4 weeks before)

**Audience building:**
- Start posting about what you're building (build in public)
- Collect a waitlist or email list
- Identify 20-50 people who would be great early users
- Reach out to community leaders / influencers in your space

**Content prep:**
- Write your launch post (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Reddit)
- Prepare 3-5 social posts for launch week
- Create a short demo video or GIF (30-60 seconds)
- Write the Product Hunt tagline + description (if applicable)

**Product prep:**
- Fix critical bugs in the main user flow
- Set up basic analytics (track signups, key actions)
- Test onboarding — have 3 people try it and watch them
- Prepare a feedback collection method (Typeform, DM, in-app)

**Asset checklist:**
- [ ] Landing page live and tested
- [ ] Demo video or screenshots
- [ ] Launch post draft (for each platform)
- [ ] Email to waitlist drafted
- [ ] 3-5 people confirmed to support on launch day
- [ ] Analytics/tracking set up

#### Launch Day

**Morning:**
- Publish on primary platform(s)
- Send waitlist email
- Post on social media
- DM your 20-50 target early users

**Throughout the day:**
- Respond to every comment and question (within 30 min)
- Share updates: "50 signups in the first hour — thank you"
- Ask early supporters to share/upvote
- Collect and note all feedback

**Evening:**
- Post a recap: "Here's what happened today"
- Thank supporters publicly
- Note the top 3 pieces of feedback
- Plan tomorrow's follow-up

#### Post-Launch (First 7 days)

**Day 1-3:**
- Follow up with everyone who signed up
- Respond to all feedback
- Fix the #1 thing users complained about
- Post daily updates on what you learned

**Day 4-7:**
- Share user stories / testimonials (with permission)
- Implement top-requested improvement
- Write a "launch retrospective" post
- Plan the next 30 days

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Playbooks

#### LinkedIn Launch

**Best for:** B2B, professional tools, founder audiences

**Post structure:**
1. Hook — personal story or surprising statement
2. Problem — what you noticed / experienced
3. Solution — what you built (keep it brief)
4. Results — any early traction or feedback
5. CTA — try it, link in comments

**Tips:**
- Post the link in the first comment, not the body (better reach)
- Tag relevant people (co-founders, early users, supporters)
- Engage with every comment in the first 2 hours
- Post between 8-10am on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday

#### Twitter/X Launch

**Best for:** Tech products, developer tools, startup audience

**Thread structure:**
1. Hook tweet — the outcome or bold claim
2. Problem — what's broken today
3. Solution — what you built
4. Demo — screenshot, video, or GIF
5. Social proof — early feedback or numbers
6. CTA — try it, link

**Tips:**
- Pin the thread to your profile
- Quote-tweet with different angles throughout the day
- Engage with all replies
- Ask people to RT if they find it useful

#### Product Hunt Launch

**Best for:** Products with visual appeal, clear category, and some existing traction

**Prep:**
- Schedule for Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday (12:01 AM PT)
- Prepare: tagline (60 chars), description, 5+ screenshots, maker comment
- Line up 5-10 supporters to upvote and comment early (within first 2 hours)
- Write a detailed maker comment — tell the story behind the product

**Day-of:**
- Post your maker comment immediately
- Share the PH link on all social channels
- Respond to every comment on PH
- Don't explicitly ask for upvotes (against PH rules) — ask people to "check it out and share feedback"

#### Reddit / Community Launch

**Best for:** Niche products targeting specific communities

**Rules:**
- Be a community member first — don't just drop a link
- Frame as "I built this" or "sharing what I learned," not an ad
- Accept criticism gracefully
- Provide genuine value in the post beyond just promoting

#### Hacker News Launch

**Best for:** Technical products, open-source, developer tools

**Tips:**
- Title format: "Show HN: [Product] – [one-line description]"
- Lead with the technical story or interesting problem
- Be authentic about limitations and stage
- Respond to every comment, especially critical ones

## Principles

- **Launch is a process, not an event.** The launch day matters, but pre-launch prep and post-launch follow-through matter more.
- **Match the launch to the stage.** A soft launch for 20 people is not a failure. It's the right move when you're still learning.
- **Engage, don't broadcast.** A launch isn't a press release. It's the start of a conversation.
- **Momentum over spike.** A steady stream of signups over 30 days beats a spike that dies on day 2.
- **Every launch is practice.** You'll launch features, updates, and pivots many times. Each one gets better.
