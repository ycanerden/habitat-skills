## Use Cases & Outputs

### Use Case 1: What do VCs look for?

**User:** "What do VCs look for in a pitch?"

**Agent delivers:**

**What VCs Look For (Synthesized from a16z, Sequoia, YC)**

**1. Huge Market (TAM)**
- VCs want markets that can support a $1B+ company
- "The market pulls the product out of the startup" - Marc Andreessen
- Look for 10x growth markets, not shrinking ones

**2. Exceptional Team**
- "We bet on the jockey, not the horse" - Sequoia
- Unfair advantage: domain expertise, technical chops, or founder-market fit
- Ability to attract talent and execute

**3. Product Traction**
- YC: "Make something people want"
- Show: user growth, revenue, retention, engagement
- Better: 100 users who love you than 10,000 who are lukewarm

**4. Clear Differentiation**
- "What's your unfair advantage?" - Peter Thiel
- Why can't a competitor copy you?
- Network effects, proprietary tech, or distribution advantage

**5. Big Vision, Pragmatic Execution**
- "Think big, start small" - Steve Blank

### Use Case 2: YC Application Tips

**User:** "How do I apply to Y Combinator?"

**Agent delivers:**

**Y Combinator Application Tips (from YC Partners)**

**What YC Looks For:**
1. **Clear, concise idea** - Explain in one sentence what you do
2. **Traction** - Even small traction beats no traction
3. **Insight** - Show you understand your users deeply
4. **Determination** - Resilience matters more than pedigree
5. **Team** - Co-founders who've worked together before (ideal)

**Application Questions (Key Ones):**
- **"What is your company going to make?"** - Be specific, not vague
- **"Why did you pick this idea?"** - Personal connection matters
- **"What do you understand about your users that others don't?"** - Show deep insight
- **"How will you make money?"** - Have a plan, even if it changes

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Too vague: "AI-powered platform for X"
- ❌ No traction: "We just started last week"
- ❌ Solving a non-problem: "I thought this would be cool"
- ❌ Solo founder with no technical co-founder

**Pro Tips from YC:**
- Apply even if you're unsure—worst case, you get feedback
- Make a video that shows your product working (not slides)
- Be yourself in the interview—authenticity > polish

**Timeline:**
- Apply 3-4 weeks before deadline (earlier is better)
- Interviews: 10 minutes, in-person or video
- Decision: 1-2 weeks after interview

### Use Case 4: Should I join an accelerator?

**User:** "Should I apply to an accelerator?"

**Agent delivers:**

**Should You Apply to an Accelerator?**

**When accelerators are worth it:**
✅ You're pre-seed or seed stage
✅ You need structure and accountability
✅ You want mentorship from experienced founders
✅ You need a network (investors, customers, talent)
✅ You're open to pivoting based on feedback

**When to skip accelerators:**
❌ You already have strong traction (growing 20%+ MoM)
❌ You have deep industry connections (warm VC intros)
❌ You're post-Series A (too late for most accelerators)
❌ You're not willing to relocate (if required)
❌ Equity cost is too high for your stage

**Top Accelerators Compared:**

| Accelerator | Equity | Investment | Duration | Best For |
|-------------|--------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Y Combinator** | 7% | $500K | 3 months | Software, ambitious founders |
| **Techstars** | 6% | $120K | 3 months | Mentor-driven, global |
| **Antler** | 9% | $100K | 10 weeks | Pre-seed, co-founder matching |
| **500 Global** | 6% | $150K | 4 months | Growth hacking, international |
| **Entrepreneur First** | 10% | £80K | 6 months | Pre-idea, technical talent |

**Key Decision Factors:**
1. **Equity cost vs value** - Is 7% worth the YC brand and network?
2. **Stage fit** - Are you at the right stage for this program?
3. **Location** - Can you relocate for 3 months?
4. **Batch quality** - Strong co-batch = better network
5. **Post-program support** - Do they help with fundraising?

**Alternatives to Accelerators:**
- **Angel investors** - Less dilution, more flexible
- **Incubators** - Longer-term, less structured
- **Communities** - Free networks (Indie Hackers, Hacker News)
- **Solo build** - Keep 100% equity, slower network growth

### Use Case 5: Preparing for a VC Meeting

**User:** "I have a meeting with Sequoia next week. How do I prepare?"

**Agent delivers:**

**How to Prepare for a VC Meeting (Sequoia Edition)**

**Before the Meeting:**

**1. Research the Partner**
- Read their blog posts and tweets
- Study their portfolio (what do they invest in?)
- Understand their thesis (why would they care about your space?)

**2. Prepare Your Deck** (10-15 slides)
- Problem (why this matters)
- Solution (your product)
- Market size (TAM, SAM, SOM)
- Traction (growth metrics, revenue)
- Business model (how you make money)
- Competition (why you win)
- Team (why you're uniquely positioned)
- Ask (how much, what for)

**3. Know Your Metrics Cold**
- MRR/ARR
- Growth rate (MoM, YoY)
- CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio
- Churn rate
- NPS or retention

**4. Anticipate Questions**
- "Why now?" (timing/market inflection)
- "Why you?" (unfair advantage)
- "What's your biggest risk?" (honest self-awareness)
- "How will you use this capital?" (clear milestones)

**During the Meeting:**

**First 5 Minutes: The Hook**
- Start with traction or a compelling story
- "We've grown 30% MoM for 6 months straight"
- "Our users are begging us to build X"

**Next 20 Minutes: The Pitch**
- Walk through deck (don't read slides)
- Focus on: problem, solution, traction, ask
- Leave time for questions (VCs want to engage)

**Last 10 Minutes: Questions**
- Answer directly and honestly
- If you don't know, say "I don't know, but here's how I'll find out"
- Show coachability: "That's a great point, I'll think about that"

**After the Meeting:**

**1. Send Follow-Up Email (within 24 hours)**
- Thank them for their time
- Answer any open questions
- Attach pitch deck and any metrics discussed
- Propose next steps (second meeting, due diligence)

**2. Stay in Touch**
- Share monthly updates (even if they passed)
- VCs want to see progress before investing
- "We hit $50K MRR this month, thought you'd want to know"

**3. Know When to Move On**
- If they pass, ask for feedback
- VCs rarely change their mind—focus on next leads
- Don't burn bridges (they may invest in Series A)

**Sequoia-Specific Tips:**
- They love "product people" who obsess over craft
- Show: missionary zeal, not mercenary mindset
- Be prepared for tough questions (they stress-test you)
- If you get in: leverage their network hard (they're known for operational support)

## Framework: The VC Evaluation Matrix

Use this to self-assess before pitching VCs:

| Criteria | Weight | Your Score (1-10) | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| **Market Size** | 20% | ___ | TAM > $1B? Growing fast? |
| **Traction** | 25% | ___ | Growth rate? Revenue? Users? |
| **Team** | 20% | ___ | Founder-market fit? Execution? |
| **Product** | 15% | ___ | 10x better than alternatives? |
| **Differentiation** | 10% | ___ | Unfair advantage? Defensibility? |
| **Business Model** | 10% | ___ | Clear path to revenue? |

**How to use:**
1. Score yourself honestly (1-10 per criterion)
2. Multiply by weight to get weighted score
3. Total score > 7.0 = ready to pitch VCs
4. Total score < 7.0 = focus on building traction first

## Common Myths About VCs (Debunked)

**Myth 1: "VCs only care about Stanford/Harvard pedigree"**
**Truth:** They care about traction and insight. YC, a16z, and Sequoia have all funded non-Ivy founders.

**Myth 2: "You need a warm intro to get a meeting"**
**Truth:** Warm intros help, but cold emails work if you have traction. VCs don't want to miss the next Airbnb.

**Myth 3: "VCs steal ideas"**
**Truth:** Extremely rare. VCs sign NDAs are worthless—they see 1,000+ pitches/year. Your execution matters more than your idea.

**Myth 4: "Getting VC funding = success"**
**Truth:** Only 1 in 10 VC-backed startups succeed. VC funding is a tool, not a goal.

**Myth 5: "VCs are the enemy"**
**Truth:** Aligned incentives. VCs want you to succeed (they own 10-30% of your company). They're partners, not overlords.
