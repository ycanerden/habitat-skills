# Habitat Skills × Sprint Phases

How to use Habitat Skills alongside the Habitat Sprint app during an evening session.

The app tracks your progress. The skills do the thinking.

## First Time? Start Here

Before Phase 1, run the onboarding skill. Just say **"Get started"** — it takes under 2 minutes, shows you what Habitat Skills can do, and sets up your context automatically.

## Phase 1: Idea & Business Model (60 min)

**App tasks:** Problem statement, solution, target customer, unfair advantage, problem validation, success metrics

**Skills to use:**

| Order | Skill | Time | What it does |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `/founder-context` | 5 min | Set up your project context — all other skills will use this |
| 2 | `/idea-validation` | 20 min | Get a validation scorecard: problem severity, market size, riskiest assumptions |
| 3 | `/competitor-research` | 15 min | Map competitors, find gaps, identify your positioning angle |
| 4 | `/customer-segments` | 15 min | Generate 3-5 customer segments with pain points and where to find them |

**Tip:** Run `/founder-context` first. It saves your idea, audience, and goals so you don't have to repeat yourself for every other skill.

**What to paste into the app:** Use the outputs from idea-validation (problem, solution, metrics) and customer-segments (target customer) to fill in your Phase 1 tasks in the sprint app.

## Phase 2: Build Prototype & Customer Discovery (90 min)

**App tasks:** MVP prompt, build & deploy, outreach message, contact list

**Skills to use:**

| Order | Skill | Time | What it does |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `/mvp-scope` | 10 min | Cut your feature list to the absolute minimum. Get a build checklist. |
| 2 | `/prototype-sprint` | 60 min | Follow the 5-hour sprint framework — scope, setup, build, polish, ship |
| 3 | `/first-users` | 10 min | Generate outreach templates and a contact list for your target segments |
| 4 | `/customer-segments` | 10 min | Get personalized outreach messages per segment + LinkedIn search queries |

**Tip:** Ask `/mvp-scope` before you start building. The #1 mistake is building too much. Let it tell you what to cut.

**Tip:** Use the outreach templates from `/first-users` to fill in your outreach message task in the sprint app.

## Phase 3: Demo & Pitch (20 min)

**App tasks:** 30-second pitch, demo test, demo to group

**Skills to use:**

| Order | Skill | Time | What it does |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `/pitch-deck` | 10 min | Generate a 30-second pitch, demo script, and objection prep |

**Tip:** The pitch skill auto-fills from your founder-context. If you set up context in Phase 1, your pitch will reference your actual problem, solution, and traction.

**Before you demo:**
- Test the core flow works (click through it twice)
- Make sure your URL is live
- Know your first line by heart
- Have backup screenshots in case of wifi issues

## Phase 4: Extra Mile (After the Evening)

**App tasks:** Landing page, social launch post, domain, analytics, outreach, community

**Skills to use:**

| Task | Skill | What it does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Landing page | `/landing-page` | Write copy + build a deployable landing page |
| Social launch | `/social-content` | Create LinkedIn/Twitter launch posts, build-in-public templates |
| Outreach | `/first-users` | Execute the outreach playbook — first 10, then 100 users |
| Launch strategy | `/launch-plan` | Plan a phased launch: pre-launch, launch day, post-launch |

**Tip:** Phase 4 is where the real work begins. The evening gives you momentum — these skills help you keep it going for 30 days.
